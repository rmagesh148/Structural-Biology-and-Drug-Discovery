    "## **Protein-Protein Interaction Overview**\n",
    "Protein-protein interactions represent crucial control points in biological systems, mediating everything from signal transduction to enzyme regulation. These interactions typically involve large contact surfaces (1,000-2,000 Å²) with multiple binding hotspots, creating both challenges and opportunities for drug design. Unlike traditional small molecule binding pockets, PPI interfaces are often flat, extended, and more dynamic, requiring innovative approaches for therapeutic intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "PPIs can be targeted through various strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Small molecules targeting hotspot regions\n",
    "- Peptide-based inhibitors mimicking interface regions\n",
    "- Protein-based therapeutics (biologics)\n",
    "- Allosteric modulators affecting interface formation\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding PPI interfaces is critical for drug development because:\n",
    "- Many disease states involve dysregulated protein-protein interactions\n",
    "- PPI interfaces are often highly specific, potentially reducing off-target effects\n",
    "- Different classes of PPIs may require different therapeutic approaches\n",
    "- Interface dynamics can provide multiple druggable states\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent successes in targeting PPIs, such as Bcl-2 family inhibitors and PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, have validated these interactions as therapeutic targets. Modern drug discovery increasingly relies on detailed structural understanding of protein-protein interfaces, combined with computational methods to identify druggable sites and design appropriate therapeutic agents.\n",

Most of these methods work well when part of the protein structure you plan to model is similar to the existing 3D protein structure in the database or if there is a sequence similarity between the protein of unknown 3D structure and a known structure. If sequence similarity is more than 40% then model generated from theoretical methods works well. Higher the sequence similarity between known and unknown, the better the model is.\n",

    "### **Objectives:**\n",
    "Here, we take the sequence of a protein from the Uniprot database and model it using the Alphafold server. We will model human proprotein *convertase subtilisin/kexin type 7 (PCSK7)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Steps to Complete Activity**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1. Navigate to protein database**\n",
    "1. Go to Uniprot https://www.uniprot.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2. Download protein sequence**\n",
    "1. At UniProtKB  enter `PCSK7` and check for entry `Q16549  Homo sapiens (human)`.\n",
    "2. Scroll down to the sequence\n",
    "3. Download (or cut and paste into text editor) the fasta formatted sequence (should be displayed).\n",
    "4. Save the file as *PCSK7.txt*\n",
    "    - <u>Note</u>: The protein should have 785 amino acids.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 3. Navigating to Alphafold Server**\n",
    "1. Go to Alphafold server: https://alphafoldserver.com/\n",
    "2. Continue with Google and accept the terms. You will see the following window (below). Paste the sequence you saved in the notepad\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/alphafold_request.png\" width=800 /></center><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 4. Submitting to Alphafold Server**\n",
    "1. Continue to preview job and submit.\n",
    "2. Once the job is completed you will see the date and time and click that and use the download option to download the zip folder.\n",
    "3. On the same screen you will see the structure of the molecule displayed and very high to very low pIDDT. Low and very low are displayed in yellow and orange. On the structure the chains having yellow and orange are low and very low. Those structures that look similar to sphagetti are not reliable structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/alphafold_output.png\" width=800 /></center><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 5. Next Steps**\n",
    "1. Within the downloaded folder named fold-xxxx different structures are downloaded and are named model 0, model 1, etc.  For the purpose of drug design you can remove the sphagetti type of structures using PyMOL and use the proper folded structure for analysis.  You can check the quality of the structure using a Ramachandran Map.\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "Users should be able to visualize complex interactions of protein surface using PyMol. Identify the amino acid residues involved in stabilizing the protein-protein interaction and details of the nature of interaction, such as hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction between two proteins. Users should also be able to perform protein modeling of unknown 3D structures from protein sequences data using the Alphafold server and analyze the quality of 3D structures produced from Alphafold.\n",
