    "## **Protein-Protein Interaction Overview**\n",
    "Protein-protein interactions represent crucial control points in biological systems, mediating everything from signal transduction to enzyme regulation. These interactions typically involve large contact surfaces (1,000-2,000 Ã…Â²) with multiple binding hotspots, creating both challenges and opportunities for drug design. Unlike traditional small molecule binding pockets, PPI interfaces are often flat, extended, and more dynamic, requiring innovative approaches for therapeutic intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "PPIs can be targeted through various strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Small molecules targeting hotspot regions\n",
    "- Peptide-based inhibitors mimicking interface regions\n",
    "- Protein-based therapeutics (biologics)\n",
    "- Allosteric modulators affecting interface formation\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding PPI interfaces is critical for drug development because:\n",
    "- Many disease states involve dysregulated protein-protein interactions\n",
    "- PPI interfaces are often highly specific, potentially reducing off-target effects\n",
    "- Different classes of PPIs may require different therapeutic approaches\n",
    "- Interface dynamics can provide multiple druggable states\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent successes in targeting PPIs, such as Bcl-2 family inhibitors and PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, have validated these interactions as therapeutic targets. Modern drug discovery increasingly relies on detailed structural understanding of protein-protein interfaces, combined with computational methods to identify druggable sites and design appropriate therapeutic agents.\n"

    "\n",
    "### **Steps to Complete Activity**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Load the PDB File**\n",
    "1. Load the PDB file using the following PyMOL command:<br>\n",
    "     `fetch 1YCR` <br>\n",
    "     - The 3D structure of the p53-MDM2 complex will load, showing both protein chains in a basic cartoon representation.\n",
    "     - Both MDM2 and p53 have helical secondary structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Highlight p53 Peptide**\n",
    "1. Color the p53 peptide in blue:<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Step 3: Identify and Analyze Secondary Structures**\n",
    "1. Identify the secondary structure elements involved in the interaction. Note that p53 interacts with MDM2 through its helical secondary structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 6: Change Display Modes**\n",
    "1. Hide the cartoon representation:<br>\n",
    "   `hide cartoon`\n",
    "2. Show the structure as lines:<br>\n",
    "   `show lines`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 7: Display Sequence and Find Polar Contacts**\n",

    "2. Note the hydrophobic interactions between residues in *MDM2* and *p53*.\n",
    "3. You can move the center mouse roll up and down to adjust the slab position of the structure so that you get minimum overlap of residues. Using the middle roller on the mouse adjust the structure such a way that only sticks ar eclearly visible and some part of the protein is out of the view\n",
    "4. In the 3D structure observe that L57, I99, F86, F91 and V75 of MDM2 form a hydrophobic pocket  that accomodates F19, W23, L26 as shown in the figure\n",

    "- N29 of P52 formed hydrogen bon with Y100 of MDM2\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 11: Generate Hydrogen Bonds Table**\n",
    "1. To generate a comprehensive hydrogen bonds table within the protein and between the two interacting proteins, you can optionally use the VADAR web server. Upload the 1YCR PDB file to VADAR to obtain a detailed hydrogen bonding table along with other structural analyses.\n",
    "2. When you Submit the *1YCR* PDB file you will get a calculated Ramachandran map, side chain torsion angles, and hydrogen bonding table.\n",

    "### **Key Takeaway(s)**\n",
    "The interaction between the proteins or interaction of proteins with ligands depends on the complementarity of shapes, surface properties such as hydrophobic, hydrophilic and electrostatic. While designing a ligand drug for a protein surface knowledge of protein surface is very crucial. Here we demonstrate the representation of protein surface based on the properties of amino acid residues."

    "Users shoud be able to visualize complex interactions of protein surface usign PyMol. Identify the amino acid residues involved in stabilizing teh protein-protein interaction and details of the nature of interaction, such as hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction between two proteins. Users should also be able to perform protein modeling of unknown 3D structures from protein sequences data using the Alphafold server and analyze the quality of 3D structures produced from Alphafold.\n",
