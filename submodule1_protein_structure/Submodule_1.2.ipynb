    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "This submodule explores the fundamental aspects of protein geometry and evolutionary relationships that govern protein structure and function. Using PyMOL as our visualization platform, we'll investigate how the backbone dihedral angles (φ and ψ) and side chain torsion angles define protein conformation, and how these parameters are visualized and analyzed using Ramachandran plots. Through hands-on exercises, you'll learn to distinguish between conformational and configurational changes, understand the allowed regions of protein geometry, and recognize how these geometric constraints influence protein folding and structure. Building on these geometric principles, we'll examine how protein sequences and structures are related through evolution, using homology analysis to understand conservation patterns and structural similarities across protein families. You'll learn to analyze sequence alignments, identify conserved structural motifs, and appreciate how this information can be applied to predict protein structures and guide drug design."

    "## **Protein Conformation and Dihedral Angles:**\n",
    "Protein conformation refers to the spatial arrangement of atoms in a protein, primarily determined by the rotation around single bonds in the polypeptide backbone. This flexibility allows proteins to adopt different shapes that are crucial for their biological functions. The dihedral angles—denoted as Φ (phi) and Ψ (psi) —are the key rotational parameters in proteins. These angles represent the rotations between the nitrogen and alpha carbon (Φ) and between the alpha carbon and carbonyl carbon (Ψ). The IUPAC definition of dihedral angles helps standardize how these rotations are described in the context of protein structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/dihedral_angles.png\" width=800 /></center><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific values of Φ and Ψ angles influence the secondary structure that a protein can adopt (e.g., alpha-helix, beta-sheet). Dihedral angles also affect the energy states of proteins, where unfavorable rotations can lead to steric clashes and high-energy conformations, while favorable angles result in stable structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Ramachandran Plot:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ramachandran plot, developed by Dr. G.N. Ramachandran, is a graphical representation of the allowed and disallowed regions of Φ and Ψ angles in proteins. It helps visualize which combinations of dihedral angles are energetically favorable for a given protein. The plot maps the distribution of these angles, showing regions where secondary structures like alpha helices and beta sheets are found.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/Ramachandran.png\" width=400 /></center><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How does it help ?**\n",
    "By visualizing the allowed regions, scientists can predict or confirm the secondary structure of a protein based on its dihedral angles. Alpha helices typically fall within a specific region, while beta sheets occupy a different area. Disallowed regions correspond to conformations with steric clashes or unfavorable energy states, making the Ramachandran plot an essential tool in validating protein models."

By comparing the 3D shapes of similar proteins, this analysis can pinpoint key functional regions, predict where proteins might bind to other molecules, and reveal shared molecular functions across different species. By recognizing these similarities and differences, scientists can make informed guesses about the role of newly discovered proteins, study how proteins have adapted over time, or gain insight into disease mechanisms.\n",

    "2. Take not of the following <u>Key Observations</u>:\n",
    "  - Helical residues cluster in the *alpha region* (phi ≈ -60°, psi ≈ -40°).\n",
    "  - Beta-sheet residues cluster in the *beta region* (phi ≈ -120°, psi ≈ 120°).\n",
    "  - Glycine residues are widely distributed due to their flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 6: Save the Ramachandran Plot**\n",
    "1. Save the plot as a *PostScript file* for documentation:\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Objective:**  \n",
    "To study the unique conformation of <u>proline</u> residues in a protein using PyMOL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Steps to Perform the Activity**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Load the Protein Structure**\n",
    "1. Fetch and display the PDB file using the following PyMOL command:<br>\n",
    "     `PyMol> fetch 5GV0`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Modify the display to hide the default cartoon representation:<br>\n",
    "     `PyMol> hide cartoon`\n",
    "     \n",
    "3. Show the structure in *stick representation*:<br>\n",
    "     `PyMol> show sticks`\n",
    "     \n",
    "#### **Step 2: Select Proline Residues**\n",
    "1. Use the following command to select all prolines in the structure:<br>\n",
    "     `PyMol> select ////PRO/ca`\n",
    "   - This selects only the *alpha carbon (Cα)* atoms of proline residues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Color the selected prolines for better visualization:<br>\n",
    "     `PyMol> color red, sele`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 3: Analyze Proline's Conformation**\n",
    "1. <u>Observe the Conformation</u>: Rotate and zoom in to examine the cyclic structure of proline. Proline has a rigid structure due to its cyclic side chain, which restricts its *phi (ϕ)* dihedral angle to around *-60°*.\n",
    "2. Note the following <u>Key Characteristics</u>:\n",
    "   - Proline's rigidity introduces *kinks* in secondary structures.\n",
    "   - It often occurs in *turns* or *loops* rather than helices or sheets."

    "## 🌟 **Activity 5: Homology Analysis PyMol Example**\n",
    "Homology analysis is an important tool in structural biology that helps us understand how proteins are related and how they evolved. By comparing the 3D shapes of similar proteins, this analysis can pinpoint key functional regions, predict where proteins might bind to other molecules, and reveal shared molecular functions across different species. By recognizing these similarities and differences, scientists can make informed guesses about the role of newly discovered proteins, study how proteins have adapted over time, or gain insight into disease mechanisms. In this tutorial, we will explore various aspects of homology analysis using PyMOL, from structural alignment to measuring specific distances and angles between important regions.\n",

    "#### **Additional Analyses:**\n",
    "You can perform additional analyses on the obtained results, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <u>Active Site Characterization</u>: Using the active site selections (active_site), you can dive deeper into the geometry of residues involved in binding or catalysis. Visualizing these residues in different representations (e.g., spheres or sticks) can reveal key structural features important for ligand binding, which is particularly useful in drug design.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <u>Protein-Ligand Interaction Analysis</u>: With the distances (my_distance) and angles (my_angle) calculated between atoms, you can understand the stability and orientation of a ligand within a binding site. Such information is critical when optimizing a ligand to enhance binding affinity or designing inhibitors that fit precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <u>Comparative Structure Analysis</u>: The alignment steps and the RMSD values we derived allow us to understand how similar two protein structures are. This kind of analysis is essential to determine conserved structural features among homologous proteins, potentially hinting at similar biological functions or evolutionary relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- Highlighting close contacts and coloring interacting residues provides a way to focus on the critical regions that mediate protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions. This helps in understanding how changes in these regions (e.g., mutations) might affect overall protein stability or function.\n",
    "- By using the PyMOL commands that we discussed, you can extend this analysis further, whether for drug discovery, protein engineering, or understanding the effects of mutations on protein activity. These approaches offer detailed insights into the structural relationships between proteins, their functional domains, and how they can interact with ligands or other biomolecules."
