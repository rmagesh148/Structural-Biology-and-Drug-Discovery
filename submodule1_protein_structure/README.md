# Submodule 1: Protein Structure

## Overview

This module serves as an introductory module for drug design, and any undergraduate student can use this module to learn the protein structure. The module starts with the learning of basic protein structure in detail from primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures with examples. Also, it provides the physicochemical basis of principles of protein 3D structure. Details of measurement of dihedral angles and side chain conformation is visualized. Each part involves examples and tutorials using visualization software. Quizzes and assignments are provided to test the userâ€™s knowledge.  This module can run on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and python commands are used. Visualization is done in GUI mode or protein structure visualization tools can also be used in command mode using PyMol. 

## Learning Objectives

1. To visualize the 3D structure of proteins and describe the details of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures.
2. To analyze the interface of protein-protein interactions by visualization of protein surfaces between the two interacting proteins. Find the secondary structure elements responsible for holding the ligand and the receptor proteins. Analyze the protein surfaces for charge and hydrophobicity using 3D structure tools.
3. To compare protein sequences and explain the similarity in protein sequences. To model the 3D structure of proteins based on homology modeling. To analyze the quality of protein structure generated from modeling tools
4. Using web-based tools, identify the hot spots in protein surfaces suitable for binding to hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or lipophilic molecules.

## Key Tools and Datasets

- Visualization: `PyMOL`
- Protein Sequence Analysis: `UniProt`, `BLAST`, `CLUSTAL`
- Protein Structure: `Protein Data Bank (PDB)`
- Modeling: `Alphafold`

For further learning, tutorials are provided with detailed instructions and real-world examples like the hemoglobin 3BCQ and P53-MDM2 complex (1YCR).

## Datasets and Software Links
Coordinates of 3D structures of proteins and sequence of proteins are directly downloaded from the protein data bank (PDB) and Uniprot sequence database respectively. Where applicable, coordinates of protein domains are provided as a separate file (in the data folder) so that users can use these files to visualize part of the protein for detailed measurement purposes.

## How to Use Submodule 1:

Start by reviewing the Lectures for a foundational understanding of protein structures. Then, proceed to the Hands-on Tutorials for practical exercises on visualization and interaction analysis. For those interested in Python, the Hands-on with Python file provides code to automate tasks. Finally, challenge yourself with the QUIZ to reinforce your learning.
Enjoy exploring protein structures and their complexities!
