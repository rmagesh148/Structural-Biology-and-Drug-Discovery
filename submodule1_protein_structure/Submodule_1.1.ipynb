Basic knowledge of molecular visualization techniques and interpreting 3D protein structures.\n","\n","## **Introduction**\n","This module serves as an introductory module for drug design, and any undergraduate student can use this module to learn the protein structure. The module starts with the learning of basic protein structure in detail from primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures with examples and also provides the physicochemical basis of principles of protein 3D structure. Each part involves examples and tutorials using visualization software. To test the user’s knowledge, assignments are provided, and users can utilize the tutorial they go through to solve the assignment problem. Public online software’s for protein sequence analysis such as Uniprot, a protein data bank is used for analysis. Visualization can be done by Pymol software. 3D visualization also involves binding site analysis of different protein-drug interactions and comparison of binding sites of different proteins. For proteins that do not have any 3D structures, a prediction is performed using Colab Alpha Fold.\n","\n","\n","<center><img src=\"images/Protein_Structure_Summary.png\" width=800 /></center><br><br>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ku9QL8IjK7hG"},"source":["## **Why Study Protein Structure for Drug Design?**\n","Proteins are essential biological macromolecules, human cells are estimated to contain approximately 50,000 types of proteins facilitating various biological and physiological functions.The drug discovery process often focuses on specific protein structures like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), enzymes, and ion channels.

They play a crucial role in determining the shape and function of the protein. The unique side chains (R-groups) of amino acids define their chemical properties (hydrophobic, hydrophilic, charged, or neutral), which in turn influence how a protein folds into its final structure. The chirality of amino acids (except glycine) also plays a role in how they interact with other molecules. There are 20 standard amino acids, each with distinct properties defined by their R-groups: <br>\n","<center><img src=\"images/Amino_Acids.png\" width=800 /></center><br><br>\n","    \n","- **Nonpolar (Hydrophobic):** e.g., leucine, valine, and isoleucine, which prefer to be buried inside the protein away from water.\n","- **Polar (Uncharged):** e.g., serine, threonine, and asparagine, which can form hydrogen bonds and are often found on the protein surface.\n","- **Positively Charged (Basic):** e.g., lysine, arginine, and histidine, which participate in ionic interactions.\n","- **Negatively Charged (Acidic):** e.g., aspartic acid and glutamic acid, which also engage in ionic bonds.\n","- **Aromatic:** e.g., phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, which can participate in hydrophobic and π-π interactions.\n","\n","These properties influence how amino acids interact with each other and how the overall protein folds and functions.\n","\n","Peptide Bonds and Protein Formation: Peptide bonds are formed through a condensation reaction between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another, releasing water. These bonds have partial double-bond character due to resonance, which restricts rotation and gives the peptide bond a planar configuration. This planarity is key in the formation of secondary structures like alpha helices and beta sheets. Proteins can be described using one-letter and three-letter abbreviations of amino acids, making sequence notation more compact for analysis.\n","\n","<center><img src=\"images/AA_Condensation.png\" width=600 /></center><br><br>\n","\n","Each amino acid has an α-carbon atom (see Figure above) as a backbone atom.
