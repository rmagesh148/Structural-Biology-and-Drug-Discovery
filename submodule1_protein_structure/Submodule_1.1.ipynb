    "# **Submodule 1.1 - Protein Basics**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "*   To visualize the 3D structure of proteins and describe the details of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures.\n",
    "*   To compare protein sequences and explain the similarity in protein sequences. To model the 3D structure of proteins based on homology modeling. To analyze the quality of protein structure generated from modeling tools\n",
    "*   To analyze the interface of protein-protein interactions by visualization of protein surfaces between the two interacting proteins. Find the secondary structure elements responsible for holding the ligand and the receptor proteins. Analyze the protein surfaces for charge and hydrophobicity using 3D structure tools.\n",
    "*   Using web-based tools to identify the hot spots in protein surfaces suitable for binding to hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or lipophilic molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Prerequisites:**\n",
    "1. Familiarity with Python syntax and basic programming concepts.\n",
    "2. Basic understanding of using Biopython for sequence analysis and PDB file parsing.\n",
    "3. Basic knowledge of PDB file formats and how to access and interpret them.\n",
    "4. Basic knowledge of molecular visualization techniques and interpreting 3D protein structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "This module serves as an introductory module for drug design, and any undergraduate student can use this module to learn the protein structure. The module starts with the learning of basic protein structure in detail from primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures with examples and also provides the physicochemical basis of principles of protein 3D structure. Each part involves examples and tutorials using visualization software. To test the user’s knowledge, assignments are provided, and users can utilize the tutorial they go through to solve the assignment problem. Public online software’s for protein sequence analysis such as Uniprot, a protein data bank is used for analysis. Visualization can be done by Chimera or Pymol software. 3D visualization also involves binding site analysis of different protein-drug interactions and comparison of binding sites of different proteins. For proteins that do not have any 3D structures, experimental data such as secondary structure data is used to analyze the structure and a prediction is performed using homology modeling using Colab Alpha Fold.\n",

    "## **Why Study Protein Structure for Drug Design?**\n",
    "Proteins are essential biological macromolecules, human cells are estimated to contain approximately 50,000 types of proteins facilitating various biological and physiological functions.The drug discovery process often focuses on specific protein structures like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), enzymes, and ion channels. Each target class presents unique binding sites for drug molecules, and understanding the 3D structure allows scientists to design drugs that can specifically bind and modulate these proteins. Bellow is the breakdown of the frequency for the different drug targets:\n",
    "* **G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs):** 33% of drug targets\n",
    "* **Nuclear receptors:** 16% of drug targets\n",
    "* **Enzymes and kinases:** 30% of drug targets\n",
    "* **Ion channels and transporter proteins:** 18% of drug targets\n",
    "* **Other targets (e.g., DNA and miscellaneous):** 3%\n",
    "\n",
    "The high proportion of protein targets emphasizes the importance of understanding protein structure for designing effective drugs. Examples include the development of kinase inhibitors used in cancer therapy and beta-blockers that target GPCRs.\n"

    "## **Amino Acids**\n",
    "Amino acids are the monomers of proteins, linked by peptide bonds to form long chains. They play a crucial role in determining the shape and function of the protein. The unique side chains (R-groups) of amino acids define their chemical properties (hydrophobic, hydrophilic, charged, or neutral), which in turn influence how a protein folds into its final structure. The chirality of amino acids (except glycine) also plays a role in how they interact with other molecules. There are 20 standard amino acids, each with distinct properties defined by their R-groups: <br>\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/Amino_Acids.png\" width=800 /></center><br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Nonpolar (Hydrophobic):** e.g., leucine, valine, and isoleucine, which prefer to be buried inside the protein away from water.\n",
    "- **Polar (Uncharged):** e.g., serine, threonine, and asparagine, which can form hydrogen bonds and are often found on the protein surface.\n",
    "- **Positively Charged (Basic):** e.g., lysine, arginine, and histidine, which participate in ionic interactions.\n",
    "- **Negatively Charged (Acidic):** e.g., aspartic acid and glutamic acid, which also engage in ionic bonds.\n",
    "- **Aromatic:** e.g., phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, which can participate in hydrophobic and π-π interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These properties influence how amino acids interact with each other and how the overall protein folds and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Peptide Bonds and Protein Formation: Peptide bonds are formed through a condensation reaction between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another, releasing water. These bonds have partial double-bond character due to resonance, which restricts rotation and gives the peptide bond a planar configuration. This planarity is key in the formation of secondary structures like alpha helices and beta sheets. Proteins can be described using one-letter and three-letter abbreviations of amino acids, making sequence notation more compact for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/AA_Condensation.png\" width=600 /></center><br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Alpha Helix**\n",
    "The alpha-helix is a coiled structure with the backbone at the center and the sidechains spread our from the helical structure. The helix is usually a right handed-coil and is stabalized by the hydrogen bonds between the backbone N-H group of one amino acid and the C=O group four residues earlier. The alpha-helix is a common structural motif found in many proteins, including enzymes and transport proteins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Beta Sheet**\n",
    "Beta sheets are fundamental secondary structure elements consisting of adjacent polypeptide strands connected by hydrogen bonds. These strands can run either parallel (same direction) or antiparallel (opposite directions), creating a pleated sheet-like structure. The hydrogen bonds form between the C=O group of one strand and the N-H group of an adjacent strand, creating a stable, rigid structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Beta turn**\n",
    "Beta turns (β-turns) are essential structural elements that allow the polypeptide chain to change direction, often connecting adjacent strands in antiparallel beta sheets. These turns typically consist of four amino acid residues, with specific amino acids like proline and glycine commonly found in these positions due to their unique structural properties. The first and fourth residues of the turn are connected by a characteristic hydrogen bond, stabilizing the turn structure."

The Beta-Alpha-Beta (βαβ) motif, consisting of two parallel β-strands connected by an α-helix, is commonly found in nucleotide-binding proteins, with the Rossmann fold being a classic example. Another prevalent arrangement is the Alpha/Beta (α/β) barrel, also known as the TIM barrel, which features eight parallel β-strands surrounded by eight α-helices. This versatile structure often houses enzymatic active sites at the C-terminal end of the β-strands."
