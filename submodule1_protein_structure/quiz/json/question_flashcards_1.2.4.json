        "back": "With proper orientation towards the ligand, side chain torsion angles can contribute to hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction or hydrophobic interaction depending on the nature of the amino acid side chain in the binding pocket."

        "front": "What happens if a mutation alters the chi angle of a key residue? Would this affect ligand binding?",
        "back": "Yes, ligand binding is affected because mutation results in any other amino acid residue replacing the existing ones."
