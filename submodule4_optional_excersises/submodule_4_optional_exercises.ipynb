The assignment demonstrates how structural features of protein-ligand interactions influence binding affinities, which is critical in understanding molecular interactions in drug discovery. We will compare two complexes:\n",
    "1. A complex with a $K_d$ value in the nanomolar range, which is typically considered moderate binding affinity (gefitinib-receptor complex).\n",

    "Use the crystal structure of  CDK2 (2DS1.pdb) protein in complex with its inhibitor/ligand.  Use the crystal structure of the receptor without the ligand and the crystal structure of ligand to perform the docking of ligand to the receptor using Autodock. Notice that there are two steps in docking. 1) Creation of grid and, 2) docking. Use the PyMol software to remove water molecules from the receptor protein and prepare the grid for protein. To create the center of the grid you can use the crystal structure of the complex and decide the center of the grid.  Using autodock perform the docking calculations and based on output provide first five low energy docked structures of the ligand to the receptor. Use the Pymol to display docked structure with receptor and show the ligand site. Also, compare your docked structure to the crystal structure of the complex. Is there any difference in the docked structure and the crystal structure? Report the different components of docking energies for the lowest energy docked structure (Rank 1). The docking program also provides binding affinity of ligand. Report the binding affinity.\n",

Use the Cluspro for docking Robo-1 and Slit2. Analyze the results and choose the best model. Compare this model with the crystal structure of Robo-1 and Slit2."
