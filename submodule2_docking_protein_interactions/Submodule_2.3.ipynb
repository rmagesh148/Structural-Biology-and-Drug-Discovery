    "## **Sketching and Generating 3D structure of a ligand**\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have looked at the docking of ligand to protein using the 3D structures available on protein data bank (PDB). The 3D structure for a new ligand, however, is not always available from the typical public databases. In cases such as these, if you want to create a new ligand and dock it to the protein of interest, the 3D ligand structure needs to be created. Here we will use the structure of Acetaminophen (shown below) as an example to show how an individual can create or sketch a new molecule and generate the 3D structure of the ligand molecule.\n",

    "## **Using Autodock when you have a ligand with reactive atoms.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many drug molecules have reactive atoms, such as halogens, in their chemical structure. When your ligand contains halogens such as chlorine, bromine, iodine you need to create the Grid using ligand and receptor both. Most of the proteins do not have these atoms and if you create a grid using protein receptor as explained in the above example, docking calculations do not run as grid files for halogens are not found. The example below provides creating a grid in Autodock when you have halogens in the ligand. Once you create the grid with halogen atoms, docking calculations are similar to the one explained above.\n",

    "## **Protein-Protein docking**\n",
    "Most of the docking methods used are for small molecule-protein docking. However, if you want to define the binding site of protein-protein interactions, you need protein docking methods since both proteins are large macromolecules. The docking of two proteins helps us to define the binding interface of two proteins and target protein-protein interaction inhibitors. Experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography and Cryo-electron microscopy are used to elucidate the structure of protein complexes. In many cases, the structure of individual proteins is known, and complex protein structures have to be modeled. Protein-protein docking methods are used to predict the structure of protein complexes. However, one must be cautious with the structure of complexes generated with such protein docking methods, as several possible binding modes are possible. If there is experimental information that can support a model, it should be evaluated and considered.\n",
    "Why do we need the protein-protein complex structure model?<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Protein-protein interactions are very important in many physiological processes in the human body.  These interactions help carry out many cellular processes. Any deregulation in protein-protein interaction may result in disease states. One of the examples of protein-protein interactions is epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) interactions. There are four EGFRs, EGFR (HER1), HER2, HER3 and HER4.  These EGFR proteins form dimers upon ligand binding and carry out signaling for cell growth and differentiation. Any deregulation or overproduction of this pathway leads to the formation of many dimers, resulting in the disease state. In such cases, protein-protein interaction needs to be modulated or inhibited. One of the methods of drug design is protein-protein interaction inhibition. To design inhibitors of protein-protein interactions of EGFRs, we need knowledge of the interacting surface of proteins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Using ClusPro**\n",
    "In ClusPro, the ligand is rotated through a specified number (**n**) of rotations. For each rotation, the ligand is translated in the *x*, *y*, and *z* directions relative to the receptor on a grid. The translation with the *best score* for each rotation is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the *n rotations*, ClusPro selects *1,000 rotation/translation combinations* with the lowest scores as possible models of the protein-protein complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "To select the best model, use your knowledge of the two proteins and any experimental support to identify the best model. Typically you should start with the balanced model if prior knowledge is unavailable as per ClusPro default recommendations.\n",

    "If you have successfully completed the activities in this module, you should be able to skecth any small molecule adn convert that into 3D structure and save it in PDB format. Use the Cluspro to dock two protein molecules and analyse the results of protein-protein docking and chose the best model as possible protein-protein interaction. In module 3, peptide based drug design you will use this knowledge to design a drug that can module protein-protein interaction.\n",
