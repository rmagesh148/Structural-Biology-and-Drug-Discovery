    "This section explores the systematic process of peptide-based drug design, from initial target identification to final therapeutic optimization. Using PyMOL as our primary visualization platform, along with computational tools like AlphaFold and Cluspro, we'll investigate how to analyze protein structures and design effective peptide therapeutics. Through detailed examples, you'll learn to visualize protein-peptide interactions and apply various screening techniques including terminal truncation, peptide fragmentation, alanine scanning, and sequence shuffling to optimize peptide sequences. Building on these computational and experimental approaches, we'll examine how pharmacological and antiproliferative assays are used to evaluate drug candidates, using real-world decision-making scenarios to demonstrate the progression from initial design to final drug selection. You'll learn to interpret structural data and assay results, understand structure-activity relationships, and appreciate how this information guides the development of effective peptide-based drugs."

    "## **Peptide-based drug design** \n",
    "\n",
    "As in the previous case of drug design, our first step is to identify the biochemical pathway and which biochemical pathway is responsible for disease state. Next, we identify the proteins that can be targeted to modulate the biochemical pathway. Then, if the protein is an enzyme, identify the binding site and peptide that can inhibit the binding site. In this case, you have to design a peptide that binds but does not undergo enzymatic reaction or the product is not formed (look at the section of enzyme-based drug design).  If two proteins are involved, then we need the interaction details of the two proteins.\n",

    "- **Scenario 1:** Known Protein-Protein Complex Structure\n",
    "    - Analyze binding surface interface between proteins\n",
    "    - Design peptide inhibitors based on interaction surface\n",
    "    - Focus on key binding regions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scenario 2:**  Unknown 3D Structure(s)\n",
    "    - Generate protein models using AlphaFold for unknown structures\n",
    "    - Use Cluspro to predict protein complex formation\n",
    "    - Analyze predicted interaction interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction to Assays**\n",
    "Assays are standardized laboratory tests used to measure the biological or biochemical activity of a substance, particularly in drug discovery and development. They provide crucial quantitative data about how potential drug compounds interact with their targets and affect biological systems. In drug development, multiple assays are typically performed in sequence to make informed decisions. For instance, when developing a new cancer therapeutic, researchers might first conduct a binding assay to measure target affinity, followed by cell-based assays to evaluate efficacy. Consider a case where three compound candidates show similar binding affinity to a cancer target protein, but cell-based assays reveal that only one compound effectively reduces cancer cell proliferation while sparing healthy cells. This compound would then progress to more detailed pharmacological and toxicity testing, demonstrating how assay data guides critical decision-making in drug development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Pharmalogical Assays**\n",
    "Pharmacological assays are comprehensive, specialized tests designed to evaluate how drug compounds interact with and affect biological systems at multiple levels. These assays are crucial in early drug development for understanding not only how effectively a drug binds to its target, but also its broader biological impact, safety profile, and potential clinical viability. Through a systematic series of tests, researchers can build a complete profile of a drug's behavior, from molecular interactions to whole-system effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assays include:\n",
    "- <u>Binding assays</u>: Measure how well a drug binds to its target (e.g., receptors, enzymes)\n",
    "- <u>Functional assays</u>: Assess the biological response triggered by drug-target interaction\n",
    "- <u>ADME assays</u>: Evaluate drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion\n",
    "- <u>Toxicity assays</u>: Determine potential harmful effects of drug compounds\n",
    "\n",
    "Key parameters measured:\n",
    "- Kd (dissociation constant)\n",
    "- Ki (inhibition constant)\n",
    "- EC50 (half maximal effective concentration)\n",
    "- Bioavailability\n",
    "- LD50 (lethal dose, 50%)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision-Making Using Pharmalogical Assays\n",
    "Let's use an example where we are developing a new receptor antagonist for neurological disorders and three drug candidates were evaluated using multiple pharmacological assays. Compound X showed promising initial results where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Binding assay: Kd = 2nM (high affinity)\n",
    "- Functional assay: 85% receptor inhibition\n",
    "- ADME profile: 60% oral bioavailability, 8-hour half-life\n",
    "- Toxicity assay: LD50 well above therapeutic dose\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark> I think this would be more effective if we showed the results for Compound Y in the same format as above and then described why compound X is better </mark><br>\n",
    "Despite Compound Y having a slightly better binding affinity (Kd = 1nM), its poor bioavailability (20%) and shorter half-life (2 hours) made Compound X the better candidate for further development. This demonstrates how integrated pharmacological data guides compound selection beyond simple target affinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Antiproliferative Activity Assay**\n",
    "Antiproliferative activity assays are specialized biological tests designed to quantify a compound's ability to inhibit cell growth or division. These assays are particularly critical in cancer drug development, where the primary goal is often to selectively stop or slow the growth of cancer cells while minimizing effects on healthy cells. By employing multiple complementary methods, researchers can build a comprehensive understanding of how a compound affects cell proliferation over different time scales and through various mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common assays include:\n",
    "- <u>MTT assay</u>: Measures cell viability through metabolic activity\n",
    "- <u>BrdU assay</u>: Detects DNA synthesis in proliferating cells\n",
    "- <u>Colony formation assay</u>: Evaluates long-term growth inhibition\n",
    "\n",
    "Key parameters measured:\n",
    "- IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration)\n",
    "- Cell growth inhibition percentage\n",
    "- Time-dependent effects\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision-Making Using Antiproliferative Active Assay\n",
    "During the development of a breast cancer drug, three compounds were evaluated using multiple antiproliferative assays. The results for Compound Z showed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- MTT assay: IC50 = 200nM in cancer cells vs. minimal effect in normal cells\n",
    "- BrdU assay: 75% reduction in DNA synthesis at 500nM\n",
    "- Colony formation: Complete inhibition of colony formation at 1µM after 14 days\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>same comment as above</mark><br>\n",
    "While another compound showed a lower IC50 in the MTT assay (150nM), it also significantly affected normal cells. Compound Z was selected for further development due to its superior selectivity for cancer cells and sustained antiproliferative effect demonstrated in the colony formation assay. This illustrates how multiple antiproliferative assays provide complementary data for better decision-making in cancer drug development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Screening Techniques**\n",
    "Screening techniques in peptide-based drug design are systematic methods used to optimize peptide sequences and understand structure-activity relationships. These approaches are essential for developing more effective and drug-like peptides by identifying critical structural elements and improving pharmaceutical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminal Truncation\n",
    "Terminal truncation is a fundamental peptide optimization strategy that systematically removes amino acids from either end of a peptide sequence. This method helps identify the minimal bioactive sequence, potentially improving drug-like properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects include:\n",
    "- Systematic N-terminal or C-terminal amino acid removal\n",
    "- Analysis of activity retention after each truncation\n",
    "- Identification of minimal active sequence\n",
    "- Optimization of peptide length\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Full sequence:     YGRKKRRQRRR<br>\n",
    "N-term truncation: -GRKKRRQRRR<br>\n",
    "                   --RKKRRQRRR<br>\n",
    "                   ---KKRRQRRR<br>\n",
    "C-term truncation: YGRKKRRQR--<br>\n",
    "                   YGRKKRRQ---<br>\n",
    "                   YGRKKRR----<br>\n",
    "Found minimum active sequence: GRKKRRQ\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision-Making Using Terminal Truncation\n",
    "Consider a 15-residue peptide inhibitor:\n",
    "\n",
    "Results:\n",
    "- Full sequence shows IC50 = 100nM\n",
    "- N-terminal truncation series maintains activity until residue 4\n",
    "- C-terminal truncation maintains activity until residue 12\n",
    "- Minimum active sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these results we create a truncated 9-residue peptide (residues 4-12), which exhibits IC50 = 80nM. The optimized shorter peptide would be selected for further development due to maintained activity and improved synthetic feasibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Peptide fragmentation\n",
    "Peptide fragmentation is a systematic method that breaks down peptides into overlapping segments to identify regions crucial for biological activity. This approach helps map the functional domains within larger peptide sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects include:\n",
    "- Generation of overlapping peptide segments\n",
    "- Evaluation of each fragment's activity\n",
    "- Identification of bioactive regions\n",
    "- Mapping of functional domains\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original sequence: FLPVLAQFVLL (10-residue peptide)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fragment 1 (1-6):  FLPVLA----<br>\n",
    "Fragment 2 (3-8):  --PVLAQFV--<br>\n",
    "Fragment 3 (5-10): ----LAQFVLL<br>\n",
    "Most active fragment identified: PVLAQFV\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision-Making Using Peptide fragmentation\n",
    "Consider a 20-residue peptide inhibitor:\n",
    "- Full sequence shows IC50 = 50nM\n",
    "- Five overlapping fragments (10 residues each) were generated\n",
    "- Fragment 2 (residues 5-14) shows IC50 = 75nM\n",
    "\n",
    "Other fragments show minimal activity, the middle fragment was identified as the primary bioactive region and selected for further optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alanine Scanning\n",
    "Alanine scanning is a precise mutational analysis technique where each amino acid is systematically replaced with alanine to determine its contribution to peptide activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects include:\n",
    "- Sequential alanine substitution\n",
    "- Activity measurement after each substitution\n",
    "- Identification of critical residues\n",
    "- Structure-function mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original:     KLWVRIPKLL<br>\n",
    "Position 1:   ALWVRIPKLL (K→A)<br>\n",
    "Position 2:   KAWVRIPKLL (L→A)<br>\n",
    "Position 3:   KLAVRIPKLL (W→A)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision-Making Using Alanine Scanning\n",
    "Consider a 10-residue peptide antagonist:\n",
    "- Original sequence shows Kd = 25nM\n",
    "- Alanine substitution at positions 3, 6, and 8 causes >10-fold activity loss\n",
    "- Positions 1, 2, and 10 tolerate substitution\n",
    "\n",
    "Other positions show moderate effects, the results identified three essential residues for maintaining activity, guiding further optimization efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shuffled Sequence\n",
    "Shuffled sequence analysis examines how amino acid order affects peptide activity while maintaining the same composition, helping optimize sequence arrangement. Additionally, shuffled sequences serve as valuable controls in peptide studies, as they maintain identical amino acid composition but typically lack biological activity, helping validate sequence-specific effects of the original peptide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Systematic sequence rearrangement\n",
    "- Activity comparison\n",
    "- Stability assessment\n",
    "- Structure-activity correlation\n",
    "- Control sequence validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original:DFKNLRPVWY<br> \n",
    "Variant 1: KNDFWPRVLY<br> \n",
    "Variant 2: WVPDFKNLRY<br> \n",
    "Variant 3: RPWDFKNLVY<br>\n",
    "Best variant: RPWDFKNLVY (improved stability)<br> \n",
    "Control: YWVPRNFKLD (inactive scrambled sequence)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision-Making Example Using Multiple Screening Techniques\n",
    "During optimization of a therapeutic peptide:\n",
    "1. Alanine scanning identified three critical residues\n",
    "2. Terminal truncation reduced sequence from 20 to 12 residues\n",
    "3. Shuffled variants explored alternative arrangements\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimized peptide outcome:\n",
    "- 2-fold improved activity\n",
    "- 3-fold better stability\n",
    "- Reduced synthesis costs\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive screening approach led to an optimized candidate with improved drug-like properties while maintaining biological activity."

    "## 🌟 **Activity 1: Visualizing CD2-CD58 Interaction Using PyMOL**\n",
    "Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which our own immune system attacks cells at our joints causing inflammation and synovial membrane deformation. This results in pain, inflammation and difficulty in movement of joints. The disease is known to start with the presence of rheumatoid factor in the body. This rheumatoid factor induces production of antibodies against collagen and hence joints are attached by T cells, antibodies causing inflammation. When T cells recognize the antigen presenting cells, several adhesion molecules are responsible for generating the immune response. In the first step a protein molecule CD2 on T cells binds to CD58 on antigen presenting cells. This protein-protein interaction results in cell signaling to T cells via cytoplasmic tail of CD2 generating inflammatory cytokines and hence inflammation of joints and immune response. It is known that CD58 is highly expressed in joints in arthritis patients. If we can inhibit CD2-CD58 interactions, we can modulate the immune response, reduce the inflammation and hence progression of arthritis.\n",

    "### **Objective:** \n",
    "In Activity 1 we looked at the CD2-CD58 complex associated with Rheumatoid arthritis, and now we are going to identify a peptide to inhibit this complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is hard to visualize many interactions.  You can look at the published paper and see the beta strands in CD2 bind to CD58 and mutation data indicates the amino acid residues that are important in binding.  To simplify the exercise, we have created a figure with CD2 and CD58 adhesion domain amino acids. Amino acids that were mutated are shown.  The size of the font and bold letters indicate the effect of mutation. Amino acids that are not in bold indicate that mutation of that residue did not have any effect on binding of CD2 and CD58 proteins.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/Arthritis.png\" width=500 /></center><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this data select E25 to S47 from Cd2 and K43 to K89\n",
    "\n",
    "If we design the above peptide, it can bind to Cd58 and hence Cd58 cannot bind anymore. Thus, CD2 CD58 interation is inhibited.\n",
    "But the peptide has 18 amino acids and has beta sheet structure.  We have to shorten the peptide looking at the 3D structural details.\n",
    "We will select 30 to 48 and delete all the other part of the protein\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/large_peptide.png\" width=200 /></center><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now look at the secondary structure of the binding region of CD2. It has a beta sheet structure with a beta turn at the bottom of the figure above.  However, for the design, you need to include amino acids that are important in binding, but the structure should still have beta sheet structure Residues 31-37, 42 to 49\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we end up with two separate chains. We will use conformation constraints now.  To stabilize such sheet structure in a peptide, we need to introduce beta-turn inducing amino acids. Pro-Gly and Pro-Pro sequences are known to induce beta turn. One side we can introduce Pro-Gly or Pro-Pro other side we will cyclize the peptide and obtain the following structures.\n",

    "Note that peptides are designed based on the 3D structure where the two beta strands were not connected but in proximity.  These strands are connected by peptide bond and beta-turn inducer Pro-Gly or Pro-Pro sequence. The direction of the sequence needs to be considered when you design the peptide. In the above example, direction of the chains is antiparallel. Hence the peptides designed will have sequence\n",
