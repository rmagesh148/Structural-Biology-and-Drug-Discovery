    "## **Receptors**\n",
    "In drug discovery we refer to any protein that is activated by a ligand result in signal for pharmacological action as receptor. Enzymes are also receptors. However, the general definition of receptor is a biological macromolecule in or on the surface of cells to which selective binding of a specific substance results in change in conformation causing a specific physiologic effect on cells or tissues. Many receptors have extracellular as well as intracellular domains\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/receptor.png\" width=400 /></center><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Receptors are the largest targets of drugs in the human body including G-protein protein coupled receptors, nuclear receptors and ion channels and transporter proteins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Ligand-Receptor Response Types** \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Agonist**\n",
    "Produce a conformational change to initiate a signal that is coupled to a biological response. Agonistic drugs work by mimicking the natural messengers and can elicit a full biological response when bound to the receptor. They stabilize the active conformation of the receptor and typically demonstrate both high affinity and high efficacy. Examples include epinephrine binding to β-adrenergic receptors and morphine binding to opioid receptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Partial Agonist**\n",
    "Activate a receptor but cannot produce a maximal signaling effect equivalent to that of a full agonist even when all available receptors are occupied. They have lower efficacy than full agonists while potentially maintaining similar binding affinity. This property can be therapeutically useful when a submaximal response is desired or when blocking effects of full agonists in high concentrations. Examples include buprenorphine at opioid receptors and buspirone at serotonin receptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Antagonist**\n",
    "Bind to a receptor but do not produce the conformational change that initiates an intracellular signal. Antagonistic drugs work by blocking the receptor and preventing agonist binding. Generally, they decrease the receptor signal response by competing with endogenous or exogenous agonists. They can bind with high affinity but have zero efficacy. Examples include naloxone blocking opioid receptors and propranolol blocking β-adrenergic receptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Inverse agonist**\n",
    "Bind to the same receptor binding site as agonists but produce an opposite biological response. They stabilize the inactive conformation of the receptor and reduce any constitutive (baseline) activity. This is particularly important in receptors that show significant basal activity. They can demonstrate high binding affinity but produce negative efficacy. Examples include some antihistamines and certain benzodiazepine receptor ligands.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/receptor_response.png\" width=600 /></center><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Receptor Isoforms/Subtypes**\n",
    "There are distinct variants for some receptors which share similar structural features and respond to the same endogenous ligand.For example, adrenergic receptors and subtypes, α1, α2 and subtypes of α1, α1A, α1B, α1D, α2A, α2B  and α2C. Similarly, β1, β2 and β3 <mark> did this get cut off?</mark>.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Agonists of the β2 receptors are used in the treatment of asthma (relaxation of the smooth muscles of the bronchi).\n",
    "2. Antagonists of the β1 receptors are used in the treatment of hypertension and angina (slow heart and reduce force of contraction).\n",
    "3. Antagonists of the α1 receptors are known to cause lowering of the blood pressure (relaxation of smooth muscle and dilation of the blood vessels).\n",
    "\n",
    "For details of structural differences read the paper [Qu et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.10.088.) (2019) in *Cell Reports*\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Receptor Drug Design Example** \n",
    "Around 1958 Sir James proposed and used isoprenaline as β-adrenoceptor-selective agonist as a template structure. A chlorine derivative dichloroisoprenaline was designed.  Isoprenaline was an agonist of β-adrenoreceptor, but dichloroisoprenaline was a partial agonist of β-adrenoreceptor. By modification of the structures practolol and pronethanol, were designed as the first β-blockers. However, these had severe side effects and hence a safer, more potent derivative, propranolol, was designed. Then again, selectivity was needed between β1 and β2 blockers, as β1 receptors have importance in hypertension, but β2 have importance in asthma. Practolol was designed based on the hydrogen bonding of the para position substitution at the aromatic ring.  Based on these structures and analysis of 3D structure of adrenergic receptors one can see that subtle changes in the protein 3D structure and binding surface/cavity, pharmacological activity and hence clinical application may vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/receptor_drugs.png\" width=600 /></center><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus careful design of drug molecules with agonist or antagonist activity and selectivity is important. Small substitutions in receptor ligands can result in large changes in the recpetors specificity. For example, in the image above it shows substituting a hydroxyl group with a chlorine group can alter a ligand from being an agonist to a partial agonist. \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Enzymes**\n",
    "Enzymes are biological catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions in cells. In drug discovery, enzymes represent major therapeutic targets as their dysregulation often leads to disease states. Unlike typical receptors, enzymes bind substrates in specific active sites and convert them to products through chemical reactions. Understanding enzyme structure, function, and regulation is crucial for developing effective enzyme inhibitors as therapeutic agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark> Enzyme Image </mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "Enzymes are the second largest group of drug targets after receptors, including proteins like kinases, proteases, and oxidoreductases. Drug design for enzyme targets focuses on mimicking natural substrates or transition states to achieve specific inhibition, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Enzyme Inhibition**:\n",
    "Enzyme inhibitors can be classified based on their mechanism of action and the nature of their interaction with the enzyme. The two main categories are reversible and irreversible inhibition, each with distinct therapeutic applications and considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Reversible Inhibition</u>: Characterized by non-covalent interactions between the inhibitor and enzyme, allowing the inhibitor to dissociate from the enzyme. The inhibition effect is concentration-dependent and can be reduced or eliminated by removing the inhibitor. These interactions typically involve hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and ionic interactions. The type of inhibition (competitive, non-competitive, uncompetitive, or mixed) depends on where and how the inhibitor binds to the enzyme.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Competitive Inhibition</u>: Occurs when the inhibitor binds to the enzyme's active site, directly competing with the substrate for binding. The inhibition can be overcome by increasing substrate concentration. These inhibitors often structurally resemble the natural substrate. Characterized by increased Km with no change in Vmax. Examples include methotrexate competing with folate for dihydrofolate reductase and statins competing with HMG-CoA for HMG-CoA reductase.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Non-competitive Inhibition</u>: Binds to a site different from the active site (allosteric site), causing a conformational change that prevents substrate conversion to product. Cannot be overcome by increasing substrate concentration. Characterized by decreased Vmax with no change in Km. Examples include heavy metals binding to sulfhydryl groups in enzymes and certain blood pressure medications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Uncompetitive Inhibition</u>: Binds only to the enzyme-substrate complex, not to the free enzyme. This binding prevents product formation and substrate release. Results in decreased Vmax and decreased Km. Less common than competitive and non-competitive inhibition. Examples include inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase by oxalate or alkaline phosphatase by L-phenylalanine.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Mixed Inhibition</u>: Combines aspects of competitive and non-competitive inhibition. The inhibitor can bind to both free enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex but with different affinities. Results in changes to both Vmax and Km. For example, ketoconazole, a mixed inhibitor, binds to the 5-α reductase enzyme, while palladium ion acts as a mixed inhibitor of oxidoreductase enzymes. *Note, in mixed inhibition, Km can increase (↑) or decrease (↓) depending on relative affinities for free enzyme versus enzyme-substrate complex.*\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/kinetics_table.png\" width=400 /></center><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Irreversible Inhibition</u>: Forms permanent covalent bonds with the enzyme, leading to permanent inactivation. Often requires the enzyme's catalytic mechanism to activate the inhibitor. Shows time-dependent inhibition and requires new enzyme synthesis for activity restoration. Examples include penicillin binding to bacterial transpeptidase and the acetylation of cyclooxygenase by aspirin.\n",
