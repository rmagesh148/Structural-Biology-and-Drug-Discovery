    "As mentioned in submodule 1.1 enzymes make up 30% of drug targets illustrating their importance in biochemical processes and maintaining homeostasis. Enzymes bind to substrates and convert them into products. These products regulate many physiological processes in the body. However, deregulation in enzyme activity can lead to disease states by either producing:\n",

    "\n",
    "To gain an understanding of what this looks like we are going to walk through designing a drug to help combat high blood pressure. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Understanding the Biochemical Pathway**\n",
    "The first step in rational drug design is identifying the biochemical pathway responsible for the disease state. For high blood pressure the following boichemical pathway can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Example</u>: Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors for Hypertension. [PubMed Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24944035/) to reference.\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/biochemical_pathway.png\" width=600 /></center><br><br>\n",
    "<mark> This doesn't match pubmed if I'm not mistaken. Pubnmed shows ACE cuts to have the following AngiotensinI -> AngiotensinII </mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Biochemical Pathway Overview:\n",
    "    + <u>Angiotensinogen</u>: Protein released by the liver into the bloodstream.\n",
    "    + <u>Renin</u>: Enzyme produced by the kidney, which converts angiotensinogen into *angiotensin I peptide*.\n",
    "    + <u>Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE)</u>: Converts angiotensin I into *angiotensin II peptide*.\n",
    "    + <u>Angiotensin II Peptide</u>: Binds to receptors in human tissues and constricts blood vessels, increasing blood pressure.\n",
    "    \n",
    "This pathway is tightly controlled to maintain normal blood pressure. However, an increase in *angiotensin II* production deregulates the pathway, resulting in high blood pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Identifying Target Molecule(s)**\n",
    "- Drug Target Options:\n",
    "    + <u>Target Renin</u>: Inhibit angiotensin I production.\n",
    "    + <u>Inhibit ACE</u>: Prevent conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.\n",
    "    + <u>Block Angiotensin II Receptor</u>: Prevent angiotensin II from binding to its receptor.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Drug Design Target Considerations:\n",
    "When deciding between targeting angiotensinogen, renin, or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), researchers must carefully evaluate multiple strategic factors. The molecular complexity of each target presents unique challenges in drug development, requiring a nuanced understanding of structural accessibility and potential intervention points. Considerations extend beyond simple molecular targeting, encompassing physiological compensatory mechanisms, potential side effects, and the body's complex adaptive responses. The following are a few of the many considerations when choosing a drug target:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Pathway Intervention</u>: Selecting an optimal intervention point demands a comprehensive understanding of the renin-angiotensin system's intricate molecular pathways. Each potential target represents a distinct opportunity for molecular modulation, with varying degrees of specificity and potential for therapeutic intervention. The challenge lies in developing a strategy that precisely disrupts pathological processes while maintaining essential physiological functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Structural Accessibility</u>: The molecular architecture of potential drug targets significantly influences design strategies and therapeutic potential. Researchers must meticulously examine the structural characteristics of angiotensinogen, renin, and ACE, considering active site complexity, protein-protein interactions, and potential for small molecule inhibition. Advanced computational modeling and structural biology techniques provide critical insights into the feasibility of developing targeted molecular interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Physiological Compensatory Mechanisms</u>: Biological systems possess sophisticated feedback loops that can potentially counteract pharmaceutical interventions. Understanding these adaptive responses is crucial for predicting long-term therapeutic outcomes and anticipating potential systemic complications. Researchers must develop strategies that account for the body's complex regulatory mechanisms and potential compensatory pathways.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Going forward we are going to focus on *ACE inhibition*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE):\n",
    "- <u>Type</u>: Metallopeptidase.\n",
    "- <u>Function</u>: Cleaves peptides from the C-terminal, removing two amino acids at a time.\n",
    "- <u>Similarity</u>: Shares binding site features with *carboxypeptidase*, which cleaves one amino acid at a time from the C-terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Discovering Lead Compounds:**\n",
    "In the quest to develop novel ACE inhibitors, researchers employ a multifaceted approach to screening potential candidates, drawing inspiration from both natural sources and synthetic chemistry. Natural product screening, particularly from venoms and toxins, has long been a rich source of bioactive molecules, with the Brazilian pit viper's venom representing a prime example of how complex biological systems can yield unexpected therapeutic compounds. Complementary to this approach, computational methods and structure-based drug design allow scientists to identify and synthesize potential inhibitors like benzyl succinic acid, using advanced techniques such as molecular docking, virtual screening, and structure-activity relationship studies. These methodologies enable researchers to systematically explore vast chemical libraries, leverage biomimetic strategies, and translate molecular insights into potential therapeutic candidates for ACE inhibition. Going forward we are going to analyze the vipers venom and Benzyl Succinic Acid. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Potential Lead Compounds:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Peptide Inhibitor from Brazilian Viper Venom:\n",
    "   - Sequence: `Glu-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro`\n",
    "   - Modified to: `Glu-Lys-Trp-Ala-Pro`.\n",
    "   - Limitations: Peptides are prone to digestion by enzymes in the human body, reducing therapeutic usability.\n",
    "   - Fragment Examples:\n",
    "       - `Glu-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro`\n",
    "       - `Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro`\n",
    "       - `Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro`\n",
    "       - `Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Organic Molecule: Benzyl Succinic Acid:\n",
    "   - Known to inhibit **carboxypeptidase**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Combining Molecules for Better Therapeutic Effect:\n",
    "To overcome limitations, combine the *peptide inhibitor* and the *organic molecule* to create a drug that:\n",
    "  - Is therapeutically effective.\n",
    "  - Can be administered orally.\n",
    "  - Is resistant to degradation by body enzymes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This design process highlights how structural and biochemical knowledge is used to develop effective enzyme inhibitors for therapeutic use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Lead Optimization**\n",
    "Two lead compounds have been identified in the *Brazillian Viper Venom* and *benzyl succinic acid*. Sometimes combining functional groups from two molecules can create a hybrid molecule. In the case of these two molecules by analyzing the complexes formed with *ACE* it can be seen that the benzyl succinic acid carboxyl group and the proline from the Brazillian Viper Venom are key functional groups. By combining these two lead compounds the new molecule is thereputically effective and is resistant to degradation by body enzymes allowing it to be adminstered orally. \n",
    " \n",
    "#### Combing Drug Functional Groups:\n",
    "  \n",
    "The crystal structure revealed two critical binding interactions within the ACE enzyme's active site. First, the benzyl succinic acid's carboxylic group demonstrated a strong binding affinity with the zinc ion, a crucial cofactor in the enzyme's catalytic mechanism. Simultaneously, the proline moiety from the Brazilian pit viper peptide showed exceptional interaction with the enzyme's hydrophobic pocket, suggesting a strategic molecular recognition pathway. By combining these structural insights and deliberately removing the peptide bond, researchers engineered succinyl proline as a novel inhibitor—a molecule capable of competitively blocking the enzyme's active site without being enzymatically processed, thus creating a more stable and effective ACE inhibition candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/combining_drugs.png\" width=500 /></center><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The original carboxyl group could be replaced with sulfur, an element known for its superior zinc-binding properties. This strategic modification created stronger coordination bonds with the zinc ion, enhancing the molecule's interaction with the enzyme. The resulting drug, captopril, demonstrated dramatically improved binding efficiency and became an FDA-approved medication for high blood pressure management, illustrating how precise molecular engineering can transform a promising concept into an effective therapeutic solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/captopril.png\" width=300 /></center><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem with captopril and design of new inhibitors:\n",
    "Captopril, despite its high binding affinity to *ACE*, presented limitations due to its sulfur content, causing a metallic taste and potential patient sensitivity. Building on the original Brazilian viper pentapeptide, researchers recognized the critical role of the hydrophobic aromatic tryptophan in enzyme inhibition. This insight led to a strategic approach of exploring structural modifications, focusing on two key design strategies. Some drugs retained the core proline structure while adjusting the zinc binding region, while others introduced bulky aromatic functional groups to enhance binding interactions, each approach aimed at improving the drug's specificity and reducing potential side effects.\n",

    "## **Conclusions**\n",
    "Our journey through ACE inhibitor design traced a comprehensive path from understanding the renin-angiotensin biochemical pathway to developing targeted therapeutic molecules. We explored strategic intervention points, analyzed potential drug targets, and identified promising candidates through natural product screening and computational methods. By combining structural insights from Brazilian pit viper venom and synthetic molecules, we witnessed how precise molecular modifications, such as joining functional groups and replacing key molecular components, can transform promising concepts into effective pharmaceuticals.  As we transition to submodule 2.3, we will dive deeper into peptide-based drug design, continuing our exploration of how molecular understanding can be leveraged to create innovative therapeutic solutions.\n",
