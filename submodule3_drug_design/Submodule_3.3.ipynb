    "## **Peptide-based drug design**\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the previous case of drug design, our first step is to identify the biochemical pathway and which biochemical pathway is responsible for disease state. Next, we identify the proteins that can be targeted to modulate the biochemical pathway. Then, if the protein is an enzyme, identify the binding site and peptide that can inhibit the binding site. In this case, you have to design a peptide that binds but does not undergo enzymatic reaction or the product is not formed (look at the section of enzyme-based drug design).  If two proteins are involved, then we need the interaction details of the two proteins.\n",

    "## **Introduction to Assays**\n",
    "Assays are standardized laboratory tests used to measure the biological or biochemical activity of a substance, particularly in drug discovery and development. They provide crucial quantitative data about how potential drug compounds interact with their targets and affect biological systems. In drug development, multiple assays are typically performed in sequence to make informed decisions. For instance, when developing a new cancer therapeutic, researchers might first conduct a binding assay to measure target affinity, followed by cell-based assays to evaluate efficacy. Consider a case where three compound candidates show similar binding affinity to a cancer target protein, but cell-based assays reveal that only one compound effectively reduces cancer cell proliferation while sparing healthy cells. This compound would then progress to more detailed pharmacological and toxicity testing, demonstrating how assay data guides critical decision-making in drug development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Pharmalogical Assays**\n",
    "Pharmacological assays are comprehensive, specialized tests designed to evaluate how drug compounds interact with and affect biological systems at multiple levels. These assays are crucial in early drug development for understanding not only how effectively a drug binds to its target, but also its broader biological impact, safety profile, and potential clinical viability. Through a systematic series of tests, researchers can build a complete profile of a drug's behavior, from molecular interactions to whole-system effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assays include:\n",
    "- <u>Binding assays</u>: Measure how well a drug binds to its target (e.g., receptors, enzymes)\n",
    "- <u>Functional assays</u>: Assess the biological response triggered by drug-target interaction\n",
    "- <u>ADME assays</u>: Evaluate drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion\n",
    "- <u>Toxicity assays</u>: Determine potential harmful effects of drug compounds\n",
    "\n",
    "Key parameters measured:\n",
    "- Kd (dissociation constant)\n",
    "- Ki (inhibition constant)\n",
    "- EC50 (half maximal effective concentration)\n",
    "- Bioavailability\n",
    "- LD50 (lethal dose, 50%)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision-Making Using Pharmalogical Assays\n",
    "Let's consider an example where we are developing a new receptor antagonist for neurological disorders. Three drug candidates (X, Y, and Z) were evaluated using multiple pharmacological assays. Here's a comparison of the results for Compound X and Compound Y:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Compound | Binding Assay (Kd) | Functional Assay (Receptor Inhibition) | ADME Profile | Toxicity (LD50) |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| X | 2 nM | 85% | 60% oral bioavailability, 8-hour half-life | Well above therapeutic dose |\n",
    "| Y | 1 nM | 90% | 20% oral bioavailability, 2-hour half-life | Well above therapeutic dose |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Compound X is preferred over Compound Y:**\n",
    "\n",
    "While Compound Y exhibits a slightly better binding affinity (Kd = 1nM) and higher receptor inhibition (90%) compared to Compound X, it has significantly lower oral bioavailability (20% vs. 60%) and a shorter half-life (2 hours vs. 8 hours). These factors would likely result in less effective drug delivery to the target site and the need for more frequent dosing, respectively. Considering the overall pharmacological profile, Compound X emerges as the more promising candidate despite its marginally lower binding affinity and receptor inhibition. This example highlights the importance of considering multiple pharmacological parameters beyond simple binding affinity when selecting drug candidates for further development. <mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite Compound Y having a slightly better binding affinity (Kd = 1nM), its poor bioavailability (20%) and shorter half-life (2 hours) made Compound X the better candidate for further development. This demonstrates how integrated pharmacological data guides compound selection beyond simple target affinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Antiproliferative Activity Assay**\n",
    "Antiproliferative activity assays are specialized biological tests designed to quantify a compound's ability to inhibit cell growth or division. These assays are particularly critical in cancer drug development, where the primary goal is often to selectively stop or slow the growth of cancer cells while minimizing effects on healthy cells. By employing multiple complementary methods, researchers can build a comprehensive understanding of how a compound affects cell proliferation over different time scales and through various mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common assays include:\n",
    "- <u>MTT assay</u>: Measures cell viability through metabolic activity\n",
    "- <u>BrdU assay</u>: Detects DNA synthesis in proliferating cells\n",
    "- <u>Colony formation assay</u>: Evaluates long-term growth inhibition\n",
    "\n",
    "Key parameters measured:\n",
    "- IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration)\n",
    "- Cell growth inhibition percentage\n",
    "- Time-dependent effects\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision-Making Using Antiproliferative Active Assay\n",
    "During the development of a breast cancer drug, three compounds (Z, A, and B) were evaluated using multiple antiproliferative assays. Here's a comparison of the results for Compound Z and Compound A:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Compound | MTT Assay (IC50) | BrdU Assay (DNA Synthesis Reduction) | Colony Formation Assay (Inhibition) | Effect on Normal Cells |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Z | 200 nM | 75% at 500 nM | Complete at 1 µM after 14 days | Minimal |\n",
    "| A | 150 nM | 80% at 400 nM | Complete at 800 nM after 14 days | Significant |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Compound Z is preferred over Compound A:**\n",
    "\n",
    "While Compound A exhibits a slightly better potency in the MTT assay (IC50 = 150 nM) and BrdU assay, it also demonstrates a significant effect on normal cells, indicating potential toxicity. Compound Z, on the other hand, shows minimal effects on normal cells, making it a more selective and safer candidate. Although Compound Z has a slightly higher IC50 in the MTT assay, its superior selectivity for cancer cells and comparable antiproliferative effects in the other assays make it the preferred candidate for further development. This illustrates how multiple antiproliferative assays provide crucial information for better decision-making in cancer drug development, considering not only potency but also selectivity and safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "While another compound showed a lower IC50 in the MTT assay (150nM), it also significantly affected normal cells. Compound Z was selected for further development due to its superior selectivity for cancer cells and sustained antiproliferative effect demonstrated in the colony formation assay. This illustrates how multiple antiproliferative assays provide complementary data for better decision-making in cancer drug development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Screening Techniques**\n",
    "Screening techniques in peptide-based drug design are systematic methods used to optimize peptide sequences and understand structure-activity relationships. These approaches are essential for developing more effective and drug-like peptides by identifying critical structural elements and improving pharmaceutical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminal Truncation\n",
    "Terminal truncation is a fundamental peptide optimization strategy that systematically removes amino acids from either end of a peptide sequence. This method helps identify the minimal bioactive sequence, potentially improving drug-like properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects include:\n",
    "- Systematic N-terminal or C-terminal amino acid removal\n",
    "- Analysis of activity retention after each truncation\n",
    "- Identification of minimal active sequence\n",
    "- Optimization of peptide length\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Full sequence:     YGRKKRRQRRR<br>\n",
    "N-term truncation: -GRKKRRQRRR<br>\n",
    "                   --RKKRRQRRR<br>\n",
    "                   ---KKRRQRRR<br>\n",
    "C-term truncation: YGRKKRRQR--<br>\n",
    "                   YGRKKRRQ---<br>\n",
    "                   YGRKKRR----<br>\n",
    "Found minimum active sequence: GRKKRRQ\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision-Making Using Terminal Truncation\n",
    "Consider a 15-residue peptide inhibitor:\n",
    "\n",
    "Results:\n",
    "- Full sequence shows IC50 = 100nM\n",
    "- N-terminal truncation series maintains activity until residue 4\n",
    "- C-terminal truncation maintains activity until residue 12\n",
    "- Minimum active sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these results we create a truncated 9-residue peptide (residues 4-12), which exhibits IC50 = 80nM. The optimized shorter peptide would be selected for further development due to maintained activity and improved synthetic feasibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Peptide fragmentation\n",
    "Peptide fragmentation is a systematic method that breaks down peptides into overlapping segments to identify regions crucial for biological activity. This approach helps map the functional domains within larger peptide sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects include:\n",
    "- Generation of overlapping peptide segments\n",
    "- Evaluation of each fragment's activity\n",
    "- Identification of bioactive regions\n",
    "- Mapping of functional domains\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original sequence: FLPVLAQFVLL (10-residue peptide)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fragment 1 (1-6):  FLPVLA----<br>\n",
    "Fragment 2 (3-8):  --PVLAQFV--<br>\n",
    "Fragment 3 (5-10): ----LAQFVLL<br>\n",
    "Most active fragment identified: PVLAQFV\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision-Making Using Peptide fragmentation\n",
    "Consider a 20-residue peptide inhibitor:\n",
    "- Full sequence shows IC50 = 50nM\n",
    "- Five overlapping fragments (10 residues each) were generated\n",
    "- Fragment 2 (residues 5-14) shows IC50 = 75nM\n",
    "\n",
    "Other fragments show minimal activity, the middle fragment was identified as the primary bioactive region and selected for further optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alanine Scanning\n",
    "Alanine scanning is a precise mutational analysis technique where each amino acid is systematically replaced with alanine to determine its contribution to peptide activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects include:\n",
    "- Sequential alanine substitution\n",
    "- Activity measurement after each substitution\n",
    "- Identification of critical residues\n",
    "- Structure-function mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original:     KLWVRIPKLL<br>\n",
    "Position 1:   ALWVRIPKLL (K→A)<br>\n",
    "Position 2:   KAWVRIPKLL (L→A)<br>\n",
    "Position 3:   KLAVRIPKLL (W→A)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision-Making Using Alanine Scanning\n",
    "Consider a 10-residue peptide antagonist:\n",
    "- Original sequence shows Kd = 25nM\n",
    "- Alanine substitution at positions 3, 6, and 8 causes >10-fold activity loss\n",
    "- Positions 1, 2, and 10 tolerate substitution\n",
    "\n",
    "Other positions show moderate effects, the results identified three essential residues for maintaining activity, guiding further optimization efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shuffled Sequence\n",
    "Shuffled sequence analysis examines how amino acid order affects peptide activity while maintaining the same composition, helping optimize sequence arrangement. Additionally, shuffled sequences serve as valuable controls in peptide studies, as they maintain identical amino acid composition but typically lack biological activity, helping validate sequence-specific effects of the original peptide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Systematic sequence rearrangement\n",
    "- Activity comparison\n",
    "- Stability assessment\n",
    "- Structure-activity correlation\n",
    "- Control sequence validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original:DFKNLRPVWY<br>\n",
    "Variant 1: KNDFWPRVLY<br>\n",
    "Variant 2: WVPDFKNLRY<br>\n",
    "Variant 3: RPWDFKNLVY<br>\n",
    "Best variant: RPWDFKNLVY (improved stability)<br>\n",
    "Control: YWVPRNFKLD (inactive scrambled sequence)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision-Making Example Using Multiple Screening Techniques\n",
    "During optimization of a therapeutic peptide:\n",
    "1. Alanine scanning identified three critical residues\n",
    "2. Terminal truncation reduced sequence from 20 to 12 residues\n",
    "3. Shuffled variants explored alternative arrangements\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimized peptide outcome:\n",
    "- 2-fold improved activity\n",
    "- 3-fold better stability\n",
    "- Reduced synthesis costs\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive screening approach led to an optimized candidate with improved drug-like properties while maintaining biological activity."

    "## 🌟 **Activity 1: Visualizing CD2-CD58 Interaction Using PyMOL**\n",
    "Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which our own immune system attacks cells at our joints causing inflammation and synovial membrane deformation. This results in pain, inflammation and difficulty in movement of joints. The disease is known to start with the presence of rheumatoid factor in the body. This rheumatoid factor induces production of antibodies against collagen and hence joints are attached by T cells, antibodies causing inflammation. When T cells recognize the antigen presenting cells, several adhesion molecules are responsible for generating the immune response. In the first step a protein molecule CD2 on T cells binds to CD58 on antigen presenting cells. This protein-protein interaction results in cell signaling to T cells via cytoplasmic tail of CD2 generating inflammatory cytokines and hence inflammation of joints and immune response. It is known that CD58 is highly expressed in joints in arthritis patients. If we can inhibit CD2-CD58 interactions, we can modulate the immune response, reduce the inflammation and hence progression of arthritis.\n",

    "To inhibit this complex a small peptide can be created that binds to this either the CD2 or CD58 surface preventing the CD2-CD58 complex from forming. With this in mind by identifying the key interactions of this complex a peptide with these sequences can be selected to be the drug candidate. With how large the protein-protein surface is it can be difficult to identify the key interactions. One way of identify the key amino acids is to perform amino acid mutations and see how that effects the formation of this complex. Amino acid mutations were performed and the results are in the \"Structure of a Heterophilic Adhesion Complex Between the Human CD2 and CD58(LFA-3) Counter-Receptors\" paper. To simplify this table a figure was created with the CD2 and CD58 adhesion domain amino acids.The amino acids that were mutated are shown with the font size and bolding indicating the effect of the mutation.

    "Here, we demonstrate cell adhesion assay for inhibition of CD2 and CD58 interaction by designed peptides. In this assay, adhesion between T cells and epithelial cells or Human Fibroblast-Like Synoviocytes (HFLS) -rheumatoid arthritis cells is monitored. Inhibition of adhesion of these cells is evaluated for the pharmacological activity of designed molecules.  T cells are labeled with fluorescent labels and HFLS-RA cells or epithelial cells are coated on the plates. When T cells are added to HFLS-RA or epithelial cells, they adhere to one another. If designed peptides are added and they are inhibitors, the adhesion between these two cells will be reduced. This reduction in the cell adhesion is monitored by fluorescence intensity. The data provided is log concentration of the peptide and percentage of cell adhesion inhibition. Plot the graph and obtain the IC50, and compare the IC50 of two compounds. \n",

    "Observations\n",
    "1. From peptide truncation experiments, the IC50 values indicated that when we remove N-terminal part of the sequence of the peptide (Peptides b to l)  activity of the peptide was reduced (lower the value of IC50, higher the activity).  \n",
    "2. When C-terminal amino acids were removed (from n to s) , activity was not changed significantly. \n",
    "3. N-terminal part of the peptide is important for activity.\n",
    "4. The peptide has two Cys residues that might form a disulfide bond. When Cys was removed, activity was reduced. Disulfide bond may be important for activity.\n",
    "5. The peptide has two prolines. Removal of prolines reduced the activity. Pro-Pro sequence in peptides introduce beta turns. Beta turn might be important for activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "From alanine scanning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When Cys was replaced with Ala, activity was reduced.\n",
    "2. When Pro-Pro sequence was replaced with Ala, activity was reduced.\n",
    "3. When C-terminal amino acids were replaced with Ala activity was not affected.\n",
    "4. Cyclization of the peptide (peptide x, in truncation Table)  improved the activity\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these observations one can choose the peptide sequence CKDTCPPLMLYNP for further modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, you can introduce conformational constraints such as secondary structure to the structure of the peptide using different functional groups or replacing the amino acids and cycling the peptide. This is illustrated in the example of CD2-CD58 peptide design described in this module.\n"
