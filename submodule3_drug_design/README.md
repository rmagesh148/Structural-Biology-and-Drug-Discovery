# Submodule 3- Drug Design

## Background
In this module, users learn different types of drug design with examples, visualization, and tutorials. Enzyme-based drug design, receptor-based drug design, and peptide-based drug design (along with protein-protein interaction and drug design) are demonstrated. This module uses all the software and knowledge used in Modules 1 and 2 and combines this knowledge to study the design of drugs. This module requires Modules 1 and 2 as prerequisites if the users are unfamiliar with the analysis of protein structure, binding cavity, docking, and protein-protein interactions. Autodock  software is used for docking ligands to protein molecules. PyMol is used for visualization and Cluspro is used for generating protein-protein complexes using individual PDB files. Each part involves examples and tutorials using visualization software. Quizzes and assignments are provided to test the userâ€™s knowledge.  This module can run on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and python commands are used. Docking can be done using GUI mode command mode. Final docked structures are used using PyMol. 

## Learning Objectives
- Learn the basics of different types of drug design from structural biology
- Analyze the enzyme binding cavity to design enzyme activity modulator drugs. Illustrate the example of enzyme-based drug design
- Learn the basics of peptide-based drug design with illustration of example from CD2-CD58 protein-protein interaction.  
- Learn the basics of receptor-based drug design with an example.
- Perform protein-protein docking and analyze the interaction surface of two proteins.

## Key Tools and Datasets
- Visualization: `PyMOL`
- Protein Structure: `Protein Data Bank (PDB)`
- Modeling: `AlphaFold`

## Workflow
- PyMol can be executed from within the notebook. 
- We will use a protein data bank to access 3D structures. 
- All the activities are done using PyMol GUI or command mode. 
- Instructions for both options are provided. Autodock can be setup on local computers. 
- Most of the data preparations for docking can be done using Notebook. 
- Autogrid and Autodock are run on local machines and instructions are provided to set this up. 
- Similarly ClusPro is run on a server using login credentials.
 
## Data
- Coordinates of 3D structures of proteins and sequence of proteins are directly downloaded from the protein data bank (PDB). 
- Output files for docking are provided for the users for analysis of docking results.  (in directory (mention here))

## Troubleshooting
+ Make sure your notebook is running on a python kernel.
+ Make sure to run code cells in the order they are presented within the notebook.
